# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Challenge
This challenge creates three tile layers from the mapbox
+ streats-v11
+ satellite-streets-v11
+ light-v9  

Use the Leaflet GeoJSON to add two overlay layers:
+ last seven day's earthquake from USGS
+ earth tectonic plate boundaries  

A legend shows the earthquake magnitudes. It goes with the earthquake overlay layer.  
To run this javascript, a valid mapbox API key should be inserted in [config.js](https://github.com/pqrt12/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/master/Earthquakes_past7days/static/js/config.js).
